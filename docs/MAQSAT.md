# MAQSAT

## Vision

The MAQSAT document ("Maqsat" in Kazakh, translates to "Goal") outlines the author's vision for the project. It aims to create an exemplary project template that showcases the integration of different machine learning models, technologies (such as Docker), and methods.

## Paths of Development

1. Independent Application: twitter-nlp aims to be a standalone application that can be easily deployed and used by individuals or organizations. It will provide a user-friendly interface, allowing users to leverage the power of different machine learning models and technologies without the need for extensive setup or configuration.

2. Template for Projects: twitter-nlp will also serve as a project template that provides a structured framework for developing data science and machine learning projects. It will include best practices, folder structures, and code templates that facilitate efficient development, collaboration, and scalability. By using twitter-nlp as a starting point, developers can save time and focus on the specific requirements of their projects.

3. Promoting the Kazakhstan DS/ML Community: Another important aspect of twitter-nlp is to showcase the Data Science and Machine Learning community in Kazakhstan to the world. It will actively engage with local data science enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals to encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and networking. Twitter-nlp will organize meetups, workshops, and conferences to foster a vibrant community and highlight the expertise and talent present in Kazakhstan's DS/ML ecosystem.

## Helping Beginners

Twitter-nlp also aims to provide support and assistance to aspiring individuals who are new to data science and machine learning. It will offer comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and educational resources covering fundamental concepts, popular algorithms, and practical examples. The project will actively encourage beginners to participate, ask questions, and seek guidance through online forums, dedicated support channels, and community interactions.

By offering this support, twitter-nlp intends to empower and mentor newcomers, enabling them to gain confidence, develop skills, and contribute to the data science and machine learning field. It aspires to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where beginners can learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact.
